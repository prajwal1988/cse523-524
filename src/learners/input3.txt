Appendix 3. Characters and character states used for cladistic analysis of the genus Parabuthus.

   Character states were scored 0 to 2, ? (unknown), ֠(inapplicable), or * (polymorphic). Multistate characters were treated as unordered (nonadditive). Three characters indicated with an asterisk are autapomorphies that were excluded from all analyses. Characters corresponding to Lamoralӳ (1978) list (Appendix 1) are noted. Refer to Table 2 for data matrix.
