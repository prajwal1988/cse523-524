1. Chelicerae, uppermost or distal, bicuspidate tooth: lower cusp larger (0); upper cusp larger (1).† 
2. Cheliceral stridulating organ: absent (0); present, type I (1); present, type II, row of setae that may be a stridulating organ (2).
3. Antenniform legs, tibia: not thickened (0); thickened (1).
4. Antenniform legs, tarsal segments with leaf-like setae: absent (0); present (1).
5. Fourth leg tibia (basitibia IV): divided into three articles, i.e. 3-segmented (0); divided in two articles, i.e. 2-segmented (1); undivided, i.e. 1-segmented (2).
6. Pedipalps, shape: short and stout (0); slightly elongated (1); greatly elongated and slender (2).
7. Pedipalp trochanter, number of large spines on ventral surface: one (0); two (1).
8. Pedipalp femoral spines: well developed, spiniform (0); reduced to bacilliform apophyses (1).†
9. Pedipalp tibia, arrangement of spines: three large dorsal spines (1 to 3) form a catching basket, with smaller spines between the large ones (0); three large dorsal spines (1 to 3) are shifted to the distal end and form the phrynichid “hand” (1).†
10. Pedipalp tibia, development of phrynichid “hand”: weakly developed, with straight spines (0); well developed, with curved spines (1); inapplicable (-).
11. Pedipalp tibial spine I: normal (0); bifid (1).†
12. Pedipalp tibial spine II: does not participate in formation of the hand (0); has shifted distally and participates in formation of the hand (1).
13. Pedipalp basitarsus with backwardly directed spine: absent (0); present (1).
14. Pedipalp distitarsus with two small denticles above cleaning organ: absent (0); present (1).
15. Ventral sac covers: absent (0); present (1).
16. Female genitalia, gonopodial appendage vestiges: soft finger-like (0); hook-like (1); reduced or missing (2); flat, with a sharp edge (3).†
17. Gonopods with unpaired sclerotized bar or plate anteriad: absent (0); present, of D. variegatus type (1); present, of D. gracilis type (2).
18. Spermatophores: simple, with free sperm packages (0); sperm packages on distal ends of movable bars (1); with reduced bars (2); of D. variegatus type (3); with reduced stalk (4); unknown (?).
19. Egg sac development: brood pouch absent (0); brood pouch present, weakly developed, eggs visible from the sides (1); brood pouch present, well developed, egg sac surrounded by large lateral and posterior pleural folds (2); unknown (?).
