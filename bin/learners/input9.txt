Appendix 2. Characters and character states employed in cladistic analysis of nine species of Urodacidae Pocock, 1893 and six outgroup taxa. Character states are scored 0–3, * (polymorphic), ? (unknown), and - (inapplicable). Eight uninformative characters, indicated by †, were excluded from all analyses. Unknown states in Aops oncodactylus gen. et sp. n. are attributed to the fact that the adults are presently unknown.
